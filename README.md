A sdk for AlchemyAPI using Golang


## AlchemyAPI ##


More information at: http://www.alchemyapi.com



## API Key ##

To use AlchemyAPI, you'll need to obtain an API key and attach that key to all requests. If you do not already have a key, please visit: http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/register.html



## Getting Started with the Golang SDK ##

To get started and run the example, simply:

       go get github.com/lineback/alchemy_go/alchemyAPI
       go get github.com/lineback/alchemy_go/alchemyInit
       go get github.com/lineback/alchemy_go/alchemyExamples
       cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/lineback/alchemy_go/alchemyAPI
       alchemyInit YOUR_API_KEY
       go test 
       alchemyExamples


Just replace YOUR_API_KEY with your 40 character API key from AlchemyAPI, and you should be good to go.
